# Contribution Guidelines

Contributions are highly appreciated as I'm right now not that experience with docker / docker-compose!
If you have an idea of how to improve it feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/Simonwep/openvpn-pihole/issues/new)!

1. Please follow the instructions in the [readme](https://github.com/Simonwep/openvpn-pihole) for how to set up this project.
2. If you're making docker/docker-compose related changes please make sure it works with the version I used (see the [setup](https://github.com/Simonwep/openvpn-pihole#setup) in the readme).
3. Every feature-request / bug-fix needs its own branch - **never update master directly!**.
4. I'm using 4 spaces for `.yml` and `.sh` files - please make sure you're doing the same ;)
5. Right now I'm not running any tests agains the docker-image, if this thing gets bigger this will change until then just make sure the build succeeds.
